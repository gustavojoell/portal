Inflation in Brazil is measured mainly by the **IPCA (√çndice de Pre√ßos ao Consumidor Amplo)**, which is the official inflation index calculated by IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics). It tracks price changes in a basket of goods and services that reflect consumer spending.

### **How to Define Inflation in Brazil**
Inflation is the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services rises, eroding purchasing power. It is typically influenced by factors like:
- Demand and supply of goods and services  
- Exchange rates (especially USD/BRL, since Brazil imports many products)  
- Monetary policy (interest rates set by the **Central Bank ‚Äì BACEN**)  
- Government spending and fiscal policies  
- External factors like commodity prices (e.g., oil, soy, iron ore)

### **How to Calculate the Total Inflation Over a Period**
To sum inflation over a given period, you use the **cumulative inflation formula** rather than simple addition, because inflation compounds:

\[
(1 + I_{1}) \times (1 + I_{2}) \times ... \times (1 + I_{n}) - 1
\]

Where:
- \( I_1, I_2, ..., I_n \) are the monthly inflation rates in decimal form.
